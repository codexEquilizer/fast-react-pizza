# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

--------This application is about ordering pizza for the user----------------

- State Management and Technology Descisions to be taken care of:

1. User -> Global UI state
2. Menu -> Global remote state
3. Cart -> Global UI state
4. Order -> Global remote state

- Routing -> React Router
- Styling -> Tailwind css
- Remote state management -> React Router (render-as-you-fetch teachnique)
- UI State management -> Redux
